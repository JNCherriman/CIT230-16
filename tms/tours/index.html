                    <p>Start time: 3:30pm</p>
                    <h5>Trail path:</h5>
                    <p>Make your way east along Main and hook up with the Burke Park trail behind the library. Cruise the paved path to Church and cross over to the Gallagator. This old railroad bed is flat and wide: perfect for an evening meander. Along the route, there are several opportunities to pull over and mix things up. Solve a few problems on the Langohr Park boulder, then check out the community garden. Turn around at Kagy and head back the way you came. If you’re still feeling frisky, ride through Lindley Park, cross Highland Blvd., and make a lap around the softball fields.</p>
                    <p>For those with knobby tires, instead of turning around at Kagy, hang a left and head east to Church, then turn north back toward Peets Hill. You’ll notice singletrack climbing the grass-covered hillside on your right; take it. From the top, you can extend your ride by crossing Highland Blvd. and riding the Highland Glen Nature Preserve trails across from the hospital, or coast back downtown along the wide-open ridge, valley views all around.

                    <p>Start time: 7:30am</p>
                    <h5>Trail path:</h5>
                    <p>From Wild Crumb, head north on Wallace. After crossing the train tracks, hook up with the Story Mill Spur Trail on your left. In under a mile, it takes you from the industrial heart of Bozeman, through wildlife-rich wetlands, right into cattle country. You’ll cruise under the interstate and over Rocky Creek, passing the Story Mill Community Park site. This ride will only get better, as the new 60-acre park will offer more trails, expanded fishing access, and benches for picnicking.</p>
                    <p>The trail dumps you out on Story Mill Rd., where you’ll hang a hard right and pass under the Story Hills arch. This is where the grind begins—a long, steady lung-buster on a smooth dirt road winding its way uphill. (Note: the Story Hills are private land and are occasionally closed for ranching activities; watch for signs and adjust your route accordingly.) For your first lap, take the road to warm up your legs. About halfway up, views of the valley spread out before you; on the western horizon, the snow-capped Tobacco Roots loom large. Hyalite beckons from south of town and the west flank of the Bridgers angles out to the north. A smile will commandeer your countenance and you’ll remember exactly why you live here.</p>
                    <p>At the top of the climb, keep your eyes peeled for a GVLT trail map marking the downhill singletrack. It’s tight and fast, and while most people travel the route downhill, be mindful of other bikers or hikers coming up. Once the trail deposits you back at the dirt road, opt for another lap or head back out the road.</p>
                    <p>If other obligations beckon, so be it. But if you’ve got the time (and energy), take Story Mill Rd. across Bridger Canyon Rd., hanging a quick left after the blacksmith’s shop to hook up with the East Gallatin Rec Area trails to the west. Expect low-vis cornering, along with trail-runners and dog-walkers—this is not the spot to satisfy your need for speed. But the labyrinthine network is smooth and shaded, offering a good spot to wind down and take a relaxing cruise before slogging your way through the ol’ nine-to-five.
